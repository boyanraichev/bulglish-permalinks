This plugin converts Bulgarian cyrillic characters in slugs and filenames to Latin characters, according to the official rules for transliteration. 

== Description ==

This plugin converts Bulgarian cyrillic characters in slugs and filenames to Latin characters, according to the official rules for transliteration. Cyrillic letters in URLs, while supported, are ugly and when copy/pasted around the internet are often encoded (converted to those ugly URLs looking like %DU^ED%â€¦)

The plugin automatically converts slugs when a post is created or updated. It also automatically will convert cyrillic characters in filenames, upon media upload. The filename conversion can be disabled through wp-config.php

It will also work for Russian permalinks, as it matches all the letters in the Russian alphabet, although the user should have in mind that there are minor differences in the common transliterations rules in the two languages.
